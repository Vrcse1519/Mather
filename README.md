### Building

**Mather** uses the [Gradle](https//gradle.org) build system for compilation, dependency, and asset management (including its external dependency on *Math.js*). 

To build a debug version of the app, simply make sure you have a modern local Gradle installation, then run the following.  The build has been tested to work with the latest `Gradle 2.14`.

```
gradle build
```

Additionally, you may import the repo as a project into Android Studio just like any normal Android project.

### License
